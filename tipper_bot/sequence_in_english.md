# sequence in english
- get params (queryid, querydata, interval, start_time)
- approve token (if insufficient approval)
- if more than 60 seconds until next interval or last tip was less than `interval/10` seconds ago, wait:
  - approve token
  - sleep for `seconds_until_next_interval / 2` (asymptotically approach next interval)
- else, `initiate_tipping_sequence` with params `retip_count`, `query_id`, `query_data`, `last_report_time`:
  - calculate `required_tip` (gas cost + buffer) * tip_multiplier ** try_count
  - read current available tip amount from autopay contract
  - get updated time of last report from oracle
  - if available tip is less than required tip and no new report has been submitted since start of tipping sequence, add a tip:
    - amount to tip equals difference between available tip and required tip
    - tip
    - sleep for 45 seconds (or retip_delay seconds)
    - check for new report
    - if new data, end tipping sequence
    - if no new data and retip count is less than max retip count, increment retip count and repeat tipping sequence
